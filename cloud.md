- Quick history/timeline of Cloud Computing.
  - 

### 1960s - 70s
1. Time-sharing began, allowing computing resources to be used among many tasks or users.
2. Allowed for multitasking by a single user or enables multiple user sessions.

### Late 80s - 90s
1. Internet created in late 80's.
2. Telecommunication businesses explored ways to make time-sharing available to more people.
3. Software as a Service (subscription-based software delivery and licensing) was created.

### 2000s
1. 2002: Amazon creates Amazon Web Services - allows developers to build applications independently.
2. 2006: Amazon creates Simple Storage Service (S3) and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).
   1. S3 and EC2 and the first server visualizations to provide Infrastructure as a Service on a pay-as-you-go basis.
3. Netflix launches, the first Streaming as a Service site.

### 2010s
1. Microsoft Azure launches - competition to Amazon.
2. IBM, Oracle, Google all release various cloud applications.
3. Amazon continues to expand and extend cloud applications and ability.

### 2020s
1. COVID pandemic causes cloud technology to surge in popularity due to distancing.
2. Security, flexibility, on-demand means users can get what they want, when they want, on an elastic scale.

- Advantages/Disadvantages of the Cloud?
  - 

1. Agility:
   1. Easy to move between technologies.
   2. Change resources quickly.
   3. Expandable services, large range of applications available.
2. Elasticity:
   1. Don't have to buy bulk "just in case" demand increases.
   2. Automatically scale services to fit incoming traffic, and scale down at lower demand times.
   3. Capacity fits the business, not the other way round.
3. Cost-savings:
   1. No need to pay fixed expenses on data centres.
   2. Don't need to over pay to allow high-demand at all times.
   3. Only have to pay for higher traffic usage at the time of higher traffic use.
4. Deploy anywhere, anytime:
   1. Move servers anywhere regionally to allow for closer proximity to clients.
   2. Move / set up at any time, anywhere.
